Bacon brainstorm

Projects to mention:
  Teabot
  Network Ensemble
  news more fun

Themes:
  why?
    why code out of hours
    code without financial gain
  chasing up ideas
    little idea in brain >> working code
    alchemy - where there is nothing, make something
    hacking/reconfiguring
      teasmade 
        - working with known mechanisms
        - learning extra components
        - change one purpose (killing) into another purpose (tea)
#  data reflecting life  
#    teabot rhythm data etc
#    commit times and ticket activity (create and comment)
#    - audible story of 'average' day in the office
#    - patterns become clearer (probably)

'chapter' headings:
  Swords to Teapots:
    - teasmade patent in 1902 by Frank Clark, gunsmith, of Birmingham. 
      (pre computer geek)
    - guns had components in a system
      - trigger - human finger pulls lever
      - ignition - iron strikes a flint, causes a spark
      - fuel - powder ignites, heats up, expels heat
      - payload - bullet is ejected at high speed
      also
      - cocking mechanism - barrel tips forwards to allow access 
    - Teasmade has /almost/ the same components
      - trigger - alarm clock hits appointed time (new component)
      - ignition - iron strikes flint, lights lamp
      - fuel - replace gun powder with oil (probably), burns more slowly, heats water
      - payload - hot water is ejected (probably cocking mechanism, possibly by steam (check))
    - Observing a system (the making of tea in a pot)
    - using known components and their interaction in a known system (firearms)
    - fill in the gaps (alarm clock triggering the process) 
    - useful useful/fun/interesting thing
    
    - BACON--- mention automatic bacon grill
  
  teasmade to teabot:
  - I observed a human process 
    - tea made
    - placed in one of two or three locations 
    - wait
    - notify via skype (or not)
    - skype contains [beverage, location]
    - (people ask if tea is available)
  - I know how web apps work
    - return data (often just pages) when appropriate request is received
    - respond to inputs (most often from forms)
    - automated processes take place (notification, data munging etc.)
    - user input affects returned data
  - Applied one to the other 
    - web page displays data on amount and age of tea
    - form inputs replaced by USB scale
    - background process updates data from scale and detects fillups
    - 5 minutes from fill-up, users are informed of a fresh brew
  - Filled in the gaps
    - scale (learn to use raw usb data inputs)
    - fill up detection algorithm (detect events in a stream of numbers)
  - made something useful/fun/interesting out of the combination of the two

Is this what hacking is?
  - discount security hacking, my aim is not to break into things. 
  - software hacking... rebuild, repurpose 
  - repurposing skills, as well as things. 
  - take a little idea... turn it into thing 
    - news more fun demonstration
  - so... hacking by combining systems... can I apply this to something else? music?
  - look at network ensemble 

Laptop Choir:
  - I know how to use some technologies as a programmer,
  - can anyone guess how I'd combine these...
    - CSV files - store data, in rows and columns (very exciting) 
    - csv parser - reads the above file, understands it as data
    - ruby - programming language, adaptable, used for web apps etc. - typically does everything ASAP when requested.
    - tcp/udp ip connector - sends data from device A to device B
    - pure data - audio/visual programming language, typically responds to inputs live, weak on sequencing. 
  - I could make computers sing together in harmony. 
  - what I like about it:
    - I didn't invent anything new, but I made this happen.
    - Using some of my old musical skills, arranging carols. 
    - I really liked the sense of these electronic sounds combining in an acoustic environment
  - Why do it? 
    - No single part of this hasn't been done better
      - sequence writer/editor
      - playback of sequenced data
      - software synthesizers - sounds, options, stability
      - network connections for synths is a little unusual, but it's been done:
        - MIDI, connectivity for synths.
        - multi-channel audio for placing sound within a space
        - choirs, bands, orchestras combine musical sounds in the air
    - so why?!?
      - learned some stuff (bad reason)
      - surprised colleagues with it (secondary reason)
      - I made it!
      - The challenge!
        - why climb a mountain? BECAUSE IT'S THERE
        - why jump off a bridge? BECAUSE IT'S THERE
        - why build a city in the middle of a desert? BECAUSE IT'S THERE
        - why do we explore the depths of the sea, the poles. Why did we leave our caves in the first place? BECAUSE IT'S THERE
        - humanity is a bit nutty like this. We don't like to see stones unturned.
      - bring it back to the original question, why code out of hours?
        - why repurpose technolgoy? 
        - why explore the space we're working in? 
        - why test the limits of what we're capable of? 
          BECAUSE IT'S THERE
