Turning guns to teapots

Like many developers, Andrew Faraday, spends some of his spare time writing code. It takes up a lot of time, it doesn't pay and often only a handful of people will ever use the resulting software. So why do it?

In order to answer this question he looks at the story of Frank Clarke, a gunsmith and pre-computer geek. He turned the skills, technology and systems he knew around to an altogther different purpose, a morning cup of tea. This talk explores the thinking that might have been behind to this re-purposing of technology and how that applies to fun, extracurricular coding projects. Eventually exploring why we feel compelled to explore ways of using technology outside of the working environment.
