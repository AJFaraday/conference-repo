Can has potions?, or 'how role playing games might structure their databases'

Abstract - draft one

I have a theory that many young people's first experience of viewing, 
interpreting and interacting with large data sets is rarely for a 
practical purpose. Children are unlikely to dabble in accounting systems,
manage large photo libraries or music collections. Many youngsters will
first handle a data set while managing a collection of items, skills
or characters.

The basic, re-usable ideas of the Role Playing Game are surprisingly
ubixuitous, making set of shared concepts many will learn without realising
it.

As programmers we often write software to deal with increasingly large
datasets, yet with better technology, we can neglect performance issues
and choose performance fixes over an optimised design.

In this talk, I'll take you through the principals of database normalisation
and optimisation and how they could be used to implement common RPG concepts.
We'll learn how to make limited resources stretch to a lightning fast RPG.

Abstract - draft two (coherency)

I have a theory that most people will not have their first experience of
interpreting and interacting with a large set of data for a practical 
purpose. Children probably won't dabble in accountancy, or archiving photos,
or maaging a music library. Young people, however, play games. Role Playing
Games, in particular, teach us to handle collections of items, characters 
and abilities. Often without us realising we're learning these skills.

As grown-up programmers we often write software to manage data sets for
business, to serve practical purposes, but we face the same challenges
the developers of those RPGs faced in storing data efficiently, to work
within the limitations of the technology used. Whether it's an oracle
server, a Game-Boy cartridge, or a pen and some paper.

In this talk I'll explore how these RPG datasets can teach use about
efficient data storage, database normalisation and system optimisations,
using what I know about running web applications efficiently to un-pick
how the makers of Role Play Games might keep the action flowing.

Outline

- Introduction to games, shared concepts (potion, skills, hit points/ability 
  points etc.)
- A bit of RPG history - focus on limited resources (e.g. RPGs on paper, 
  cartridge-based games with small memory)
- Anatomy of a potion
- - define the item, attributes, what it does. 
- - Define two effects, as two rows, sharing primary key, name etc. (1st Normalized form, has repetition)
- - Define effects as rows in a separate table, use foreign key. SQL to join, remove repetition. Less space taken
- Why do we do this?
- - An example involving a table holding tile images, then a map table.
- - The tiles contain more data, but each one is only defined once.
- Databases abhor nils
- - Side-track to an address-book application, why? Because they always have a fax number.
- - Less than one percent of contacts will have a fax number.
- - Databases will still reserve the space for that information (metaphor, a space on a paper form)
- - What does, say, 10,000 nil values look like (I'll probably use XML to show this)
- - Here's where we might use a separate table of fax numbers, to eliminate the nil values. 
- - Note that games are usually more predictable than this, every entity will have the same attributes.
- How about the third normalised form? (many to many)
- - A type of character has N equipment slots
- - A type of equipment will go in 1 equipment slot
- - A 'join table' will join character, slot and eqipment
- - Shield, for instance, can be used many times without repeating data
- How about an optimisation?
- - Show performance of reading data as individual rows, then as a large joined set. Marked improvement.
- - How about inserts? This will take longer, and games benefit from performance.
- - My best advice here is to hold the data you can in memory, instead of writing it. The best database optimisation is to do the most you can without the database.
- - The idea is balance, hold only the data you need now or will reuse in memory, grab changing data from database.
