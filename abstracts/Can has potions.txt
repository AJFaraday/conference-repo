Can has potions?, or 'how role playing games might structure their databases'

I have a theory that many young people's first experience of viewing, 
interpreting and interacting with large data sets is rarely for a 
practical purpose. Children are unlikely to dabble in accounting systems,
manage large photo libraries or music collections. Many youngsters will
first handle a data set while managing a collection of items, skills
or characters.

The basic, re-usable ideas of the Role Playing Game are surprisingly
ubixuitous, making set of shared concepts many will learn without realising
it.

As programmers we often write software to deal with increasingly large 
datasets, yet with better technology, we can neglect performance issues
and choose performance fixes over an optimised design.

In this talk, I'll take you through the principals of database normalisation
and optimisation and how they could be used to implement common RPG concepts.
We'll learn how to make limited resources stretch to a lightning fast RPG.
