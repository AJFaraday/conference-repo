When we look at how programmers got started, and the ordinary day-to-day work of a developer. It's not hard to realise that there is often a gap between the two. The work that supports us is not always the work which inspires us. 

This talk explores the value of bridging this gap with recreational programming, using spare time to explore our ideas, take part in the open-source community and coding the things we want to code. Using examples from working with the open-source music programming language, Pure Data and his own side-project, Text-To-Music, Andrew Faraday shows how coding outside of our work can enrich developers' lives.
