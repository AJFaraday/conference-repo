Re-engineering the RPG

The essence of software development is to observe the 
problems presented by a specific domain, understand them, 
and then find ways to solve these problems using the tools
we work with.

Since the 1970s, role-playing games have been designed
to do precisely that. Without computers to crunch
the numbers, systems were built to help players to 
understand and recreate fantasy worlds and the 
interactions within them.

In this talk, by recreating and solving common problems
presented in the design of role-playing games, you'll learn 
about some common patterns and problems in web application 
development and architecture. These include database normalisation, 
finding performance bottlenecks, and data optimisation.
