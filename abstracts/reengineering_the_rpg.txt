Re-engineering the RPG

The essence of software development is to observe the 
problems presented by a specific domain, understand them, 
and then find ways to solve these problems using the tools
we work with.

Since the 1970's, role playing games have been designed
to do precisely that. Even without computers to crunch
the numbers they built systems to understand and recreate
fantasy worlds and the interactions within them.

In this talk, you'll learn about some common patterns and
problems in web application development and architecture 
by re-creating and solving common problems presented 
by the Role Playing Game. Including database normalisation, 
finding perforamnce bottlenecks and data optimisation.
