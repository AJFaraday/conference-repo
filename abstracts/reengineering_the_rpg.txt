Re-engineering the RPG

Since the 1970s, role-playing games have been designed
and built to allow players to recreate fantasy worlds. 
Logical and mathematical systems had to be developed to
understand these worlds along with the characters, objects
and interactions within them.

The essence of software development is to do just that;
observe the problems presented by a specific domain, 
understand them, and then find ways to solve these 
problems using the tools we work with.

In this talk, by recreating and solving common problems
presented in the design of role-playing games, you'll learn 
about some common patterns and problems in web application 
development and architecture. These include database normalisation, 
finding performance bottlenecks, and data optimisation.
