Rails developer, radio presenter, geek, hobbyist musician and victim of a three year music degree. Andrew takes joy in hacking, playing and discovering just what sounds can be created from any source material he can get his hands on. He has been known to broadcast live feedback on the FM waveband and performing with Margret Thatcher's voice on a keyboard in a warehouse basement whilst covered in post-it notes. 

Andrew Faraday spent 5 years studying music, including the open-source, real-time music programming language, Pure Data. Using Pure Data kindled his interest in programming computers as a tool for making music and eventually his Ruby development career.

Andrew divides his time between Guildford and Manchester and spends his spare time enjoying technology, live coding and presenting Allfm's only panel show.
