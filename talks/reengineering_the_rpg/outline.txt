Reengineering the RPG

How to quantify a person
- Some facts about me
- my ability?
- how many times do you have to hit me with a sword?
- too big to fully understand 
- assess what kind of information is required

idea 1: to reproduce something in software observe the aspects of it
which are important for the operation of that software

social media: 
a name (or nickname)
image
profile
email (password confirmation)

spammers
email
phone
tags

Role Playing Game:
hit points
ability points
equipment

Simple case
5 hit points
2 damage
3/4 chance to hit
1/2 chance to block (half damage)
(implemented in simple_battle/)
