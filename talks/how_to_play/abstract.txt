As programmers, we can be pretty childish. We play with code, 
imagine new projects and solutions and sometimes we even 
pretend that we know something we don't yet know. 

In this talk, join me on a journey through the lessons of 
childhood. We'll revisit how to play nice, try our best and
always tell the truth, but more importantly, we'll look at
some of the things children don't have to learn, like how
to see the world with fresh eyes. In an age when children 
are learning to be programmers, let's learn together how to 
be children, and how this can help us all to get better at 
what we do.
