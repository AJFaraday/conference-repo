Andrew Faraday's Repo of Tech Conference Abstracts
--------------------------------------------------

This is a dumping ground for ideas and abstracts for talks at tech conferences and meetups involiving my skills and areas of expertise. Mostly:

* Coding Ruby/Rails
* Music coding with Pure Data 
* Working with open source software
* Text to Music (www.github.com/ajfaraday/text-to-music)
* Explaining tech problems and concepts from first principals to provide a fresh perspective.

This is mostly for me to keep track of ideas I've had, but if you're reading this feel free to browse the abstracts stored here. Comment on what you think of them, what needs improving, what you'd like to see etc. And get in touch via twitter: @MarmiteJunction

And if you're organising a tech event, feel free to get in touch about that, too.
