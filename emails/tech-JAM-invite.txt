Hi all

My name is Andrew Faraday, a developer working in Surrey, and I've 
been given the opportunity to arrange and present an game of Just 
A Minute at this years Brighton Ruby conference. I'm looking for 
people to join the panel and play the game.

If you are not familiar with the game, it is a mainstay of the 
British panel game genre, having run on BBC radio for over 45 years. 
In this time it has gathered a huge following and prompted many 
variations and immitations in different contexts, including a one 
known as JAMming, which is popular amongst students in India.

The game itself is simple, a panellist is given a topic, and attempts 
to speak about it for a minute without hesitation, repetition or 
deviation. The other panellists will have a buzzer, and can challenge 
if they detect one of these three rules being broken. If the challenge 
is correct, the challenger gains a point, and continues speaking on 
the topic. They can then, in turn, be challenged. If the challenge is 
incorrect, the speaker gains a point and continues. Whoever is speaking 
when the time has elapsed will gain a point.

This may sound a little daunting, but the rules really do work out very 
simple, the game itself acts as light relief and really can be a lot of 
fun to play.

Episodes broadcast recently can be found and heard at 
http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006s5dp/episodes/player 

Ours will be on a range of topics which concern the programming community, 
and specifically the Ruby community, and will take place towards the end 
of the day.

Ideally, our panel will be volunteers from amongst the speakers for 
Brighton Ruby.

If you are interested in taking part and joining the panel, please get 
in touch as soon as you can (I can be contacted at 
andrewfaraday@hotmail.co.uk).

Thanks!

Andrew Faraday
